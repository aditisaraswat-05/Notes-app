Objective:
To develop a MERN stack application for managing user notes, featuring secure user authentication with JWT and cookie-based session handling. The platform will provide a clean and interactive user interface for CRUD operations and create protected routes accessible only to authenticated users. The application will be deployed for public use on reliable platforms.


Description:
The Notes Web App is a full-stack application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes while offering secure authentication, a responsive UI, and user-specific functionalities.
